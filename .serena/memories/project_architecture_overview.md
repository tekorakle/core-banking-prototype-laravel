## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Event Sourcing
- All major domains use event sourcing with dedicated event tables
- Event projections for read models
- Aggregates for business logic encapsulation
- Example: `TransactionAggregate`, `StablecoinAggregate`

### 2. Workflow & Saga Pattern
- Laravel Workflow with Waterline for complex operations
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions with compensation
- Human task integration for approvals
- Example workflows:
  - `OrderMatchingWorkflow`
  - `LoanApplicationWorkflow`
  - `ProcessOpenBankingDepositWorkflow`

### 3. Service Layer Pattern
- Interface-based dependency injection
- Environment-specific implementations (Demo/Sandbox/Production)
- Service providers for automatic binding
- Example: `PaymentServiceInterface` with three implementations

### 4. Factory Pattern
- Used for creating blockchain connectors
- Supports multiple blockchains dynamically
- Example: `BlockchainConnectorFactory`

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **PHP 8.4+** with strict typing
- **Laravel 12** framework
- **MySQL 8.0** for primary database
- **Redis** for caching and queues

### Event & Workflow
- **Spatie Event Sourcing** for event-driven architecture
- **Laravel Workflow** with Waterline for orchestration
- **Laravel Horizon** for queue management

### Admin & API
- **Filament 3.0** for admin panel
- **L5-Swagger** for OpenAPI documentation
- **Laravel Sanctum** for API authentication

### Testing
- **Pest PHP** with parallel testing support
- **PHPStan Level 8** for static analysis (upgraded in v1.1.0)
- **PHP-CS-Fixer** for code standards
- **Mockery** for mocking

### CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration
- **Docker** support for containerization
- **Environment-based deployment** (demo/staging/production)

## Multi-Asset Support
- Primary currencies: USD, EUR, GBP
- Custom token: GCU (Governance Currency Unit)
- GCU Basket composition for stability
- Real-time exchange rate management

## Security Features
- Defense in depth architecture
- Zero trust security model
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- KYC/AML compliance built-in

## Performance Optimizations
- Database query optimization with eager loading
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Queue-based processing for heavy operations
- Horizontal scaling support

## Current Development Focus (v2.7.0)
- **Agent Protocol Integration**: Payment, Compliance, and MCP bridges
- **Treasury Yield Optimization**: Complete the portfolio optimization system
- **Production Observability**: Grafana dashboards, alerting rules
- **Enhanced Due Diligence**: Advanced compliance workflows

### Recently Completed (v2.6.0)
- Privacy Layer: Merkle Trees, Delegated Proofs, SRS Manifest
- ERC-4337 Relayer: Smart Accounts, Gas Station, UserOp Signing with Biometric JWT
- Security hardening for v2.6.0 audit findings
- Production-ready balance checking for gas station
- HSM ECDSA signing support

### Historical Milestones
- v1.1.0: PHPStan Level 8 compliance, 22 Behat E2E features
- v2.0.0: Multi-tenancy with stancl/tenancy (9 phases)
- v2.2.0: Mobile backend (device mgmt, biometrics, push)
- v2.4.0: Privacy & Identity (Shamir's Secret Sharing, ZK-KYC, Commerce, TrustCert)
