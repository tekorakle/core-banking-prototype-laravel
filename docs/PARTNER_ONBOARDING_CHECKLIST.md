## Phase 1: Technical Setup (Day 1-3)

- [ ] Partner receives API credentials (test + production keys)
- [ ] Partner installs Zelta SDK v1.0.0 (`composer require zelta/payment-sdk`)
- [ ] Partner configures `PaymentConfig` with sandbox base URL and test API key
- [ ] Partner configures webhook endpoint (HTTPS, publicly accessible)
- [ ] Partner completes first sandbox test transaction (GET request with 402 auto-pay)
- [ ] HMAC-SHA256 webhook signature verification confirmed working
- [ ] Partner can decode and log all webhook event types

## Phase 2: Integration (Day 3-7)

- [ ] Partner implements end-to-end payment flow in their product
- [ ] Partner selects payment protocol(s): x402, MPP, or AutoDetect (both)
- [ ] Partner handles all webhook event types:
  - [ ] `payment.completed`
  - [ ] `payment.failed`
  - [ ] `payment.refunded`
  - [ ] `subscription.created`
  - [ ] `subscription.cancelled`
- [ ] Partner implements idempotency keys for all payment-initiating requests
- [ ] Error handling tested for:
  - [ ] Network timeouts
  - [ ] Invalid API key (401)

## Phase 5: Post-Launch (Day 14+)

  - [ ] Transaction volume
  - [ ] Success rate
  - [ ] Average settlement time
  - [ ] Webhook delivery rate
